# Emotional Failure Behavior Specification (Locked)

This document defines the REQUIRED behavior of the system
after enforcement decisions are produced.

This applies to all assistant outputs following enforcement.

---

## Enforcement Outcome → Response Behavior Mapping

### 1. EXECUTE

Behavior:
- Output proceeds as generated by upstream layers
- No emotional amplification is added by enforcement
- No modification of tone beyond upstream output

Guarantee:
Enforcement does not enhance or escalate emotion.

---

### 2. REWRITE

Behavior:
- Output MUST be rewritten by upstream response layer
- Rewrite must:
  - Remove emotional dependency
  - Remove manipulative phrasing
  - Preserve original user intent
- Tone must remain:
  - Calm
  - Neutral
  - Supportive but non-exclusive

Guarantee:
Rewrite mitigates risk without rejecting the user.

---

### 3. BLOCK

Behavior:
- Output MUST NOT collapse to silence
- Output MUST NOT expose enforcement logic
- Output MUST NOT contain justification text

Required Output Characteristics:
- Neutral refusal token
- Emotionally compliant
- Non-judgmental
- Non-escalatory

Example (illustrative, not exact text):
"I’m not able to help with that request."

Guarantee:
User is safely declined without emotional harm or policy leakage.

---

## Global Guarantees

- Enforcement never produces emotional tone
- Enforcement never generates user-facing language
- Enforcement decisions are final and unambiguous
- Upstream layers must comply strictly with enforcement outcome

---

## Dependency Contract

Akanksha’s behavior validator and Sankalp’s response layer
MUST rely on enforcement outcomes as authoritative.

No downstream override is permitted.
