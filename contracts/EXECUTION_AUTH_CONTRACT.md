# Execution Authorization Contract — v1.0 (LOCKED)

This contract defines the **only valid authorization signal**
that permits real-world action execution.

No executor may perform any action unless this contract
is satisfied in full.

---

## Authorization Object Schema

```json
{
  "execution_allowed": true,
  "execution_scope": {
    "platform": "INSTAGRAM",
    "action_type": "SEND_MESSAGE",
    "target": "user_id_or_handle",
    "rate_limit": {
      "max_actions": 3,
      "window": "SESSION"
    }
  },
  "execution_token": "deterministic_hash_string",
  "validity": {
    "type": "SINGLE_USE",
    "expires_after_actions": 1
  }
}
```

## Field Semantics

### execution_allowed

- true → executor MAY proceed
- false → executor MUST REFUSE execution
- Absence → treated as false (fail-closed)

### execution_scope

Defines exactly what is permitted

- Platform
- Action type
- Target

### rate_limit

Executor must refuse execution outside this scope.

### execution_token

- Deterministic

- Derived from:

```python
hash(
  enforcement_trace_id +
  execution_scope +
  engine_version
)
```

- No UUIDs
- No timestamps
- Same input → same token

### validity

Defines how long authorization is valid.
Initial version:

- SINGLE_USE

- One execution only

### Absolute Rules

- Authorization is non-transferable
- Authorization is non-extendable
- Authorization cannot be regenerated by executor
- Enforcement is the only issuer

### Fail-Closed Guarantee

If:

- token missing
- scope mismatch
- execution_allowed != true

→ execution MUST NOT occur
