# Final Enforcement Confirmation

I confirm that:

• All Sankalp outputs are gated through the enforcement gateway  
• No alternate execution paths exist  
• Enforcement is fail-closed and deterministic  
• All decisions are logged and replayable  
• Replay verification passes successfully  

This system guarantees non-bypassable AI behavior enforcement.

Signed,
Raj Prajapati
